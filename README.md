# usePopcorn (Movie App)

This is a practice project.

## What I've Learned

- **Custom Hooks**: Demonstrating how to create and utilize custom hooks for efficient code organization and reusability.
- **Named Functions for Hoisting**: Emphasizing the importance of named functions for better code readability and hoisting benefits.
- **AbortController Usage**: Learning about the AbortController to prevent race conditions during data fetching, especially on frequent user inputs.
- **useEffect Hook**: Understanding the useEffect hook's role in managing side effects and component lifecycle.
- **Dependency Array**: Exploring the significance of the dependency array in useEffect to control when the effect runs.
- **Cleanup Function in useEffect**: Implementing cleanup functions within useEffect for resource management and avoiding memory leaks.
- **useRef Hook**: Utilizing useRef to persist values between renders, especially for DOM manipulation or tracking mutable values.
- **Local Storage Handling**: Creating and managing data in localStorage for persistent storage within the browser environment.

Feel free to dive into the codebase to see these concepts applied in practice!
